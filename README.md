This repo is a sort of digital garden on data engineering. Each topic is meant to be self-contained and is organized into folders.

* `data-manipulation` - A common task (not just for data engineers) is how to manipulate data. This involves selecting, filtering, and aggregating data. For completeness and comparability I've included 
* `design-patterns` - A collection of design patterns that I've picked up over the years.
* `mapreduce` - A data aggregation design pattern that deserves a section of it's own. It set the foundation for big data computations across multiple machines.
* `razors` - Some useful principles that I've codified to make my workflow better.
* `resources` - I'm not coming up with anything new. I'm building off of some great work done by others. I list those here.
